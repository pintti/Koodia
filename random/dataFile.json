Like how long with they last? All we know is for the first 3 months or so they cause little negative effects and the vaccine lasts at least that long. \n\nI think its a legit concern but we are between a rock and a hard place. Taking 5 years or more to test a vaccine long term would mean covid might be spreading unchecked for the next 5 years destroying our way of life. That was not an option. So if turns out we have long term vaccine problems we will have to figure that out then. Hopefully it will be less of an issue than covid itself."

Like how long with they last? All we know is for the first 3 months or so they cause little negative effects and the vaccine lasts at least that long. \n\nI think its a legit concern but we are between a rock and a hard place. Taking 5 years or more to test a vaccine long term would mean covid might be spreading unchecked for the next 5 years destroying our way of life. That was not an option. So if turns out we have long term vaccine problems we will have to figure that out then. Hopefully it will be less of an issue than covid itself.\n\n\n\n\nThere's definitely side effects that are of concern that officials are brushing aside in favor of knocking down infections but I disagree with their execution.  There are a lot of people with underlying conditions that should not get the vaccine regardless how dangerous covid is for them.  People who have certain auto-immune diseases and severe hypertension should not get them.  I believe some people are being turned away.  But in that regards, they should be vaccinating people who have active lifestyles, those who are frontline workers, public facing workers, and those who are in frequent contact with people.  They should be vaxxed to prevent the spread.   I said this over and over that saving a bunch of elderly folks confined to their beds isn't going to stop the pandemic quickly."

I've read that Moderna doses contain triple the number of vaccine micrograms compared to Pfizer.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/pfiz...ompare-2020-12\n\n\n\nPfizer: Compared to Moderna's shot, there were fewer reports of pain, fatigue, and headaches in Pfizer's vaccine trials. The most common side effects were injection site pain (84%), fatigue (63%), and headache (55%). Severe side effects after the second dose happened with less frequency than Moderna's trial, with the highest rates among volunteers under 55 years old: 5% recorded severe fatigue, 3% had severe headaches, 2% had severe chills, and 2% had new or worsened muscle pain.\n\nModerna: More than nine in 10 people registered some level of side effects, with most being mild or moderate. The most common reactions were injection site pain (92%), fatigue (69%), headache (63%), and muscle pain (60%).  Younger participants recorded more side effects. Among volunteers ages 18-64, nearly 1 in 5 had a severe reaction after the second booster dose.\n\nThe most common severe side effects for this age group were fatigue (11%), muscle pain (10%), joint pain (6%), fever (2%), and chills (2%). Among this younger group, a handful also recorded grade-four side effects, which are potentially life-threatening in severity. Ten of these volunteers, less than 0.1%, had grade-four fevers, which exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit."

That's one of the things on many youtube channels say is that having a responsive innate immune system is important.  Constant hot/cold showers baths to increase your immune system response.  A lot of elderly people who never had a flu before, dies by flu vaccine.  \n\nSo definitely get checked out before taking the 2nd shot."

But you're talking about people who haven't had Covid. The vaccine is definitely worth the risk to them. But if I had it already the risk-benefit looks pretty different. What's minor side effects to you might put me out of my job, and put my kids in an unsafe situation if I'm incapacitated for more than a day or two. Hopefully it'll become more clear with time how common it is to have stuff like lingering headache or weakness, vs just a couple of days of misery."

Such vaccine directed endothelial damage is certain to cause blood clot formation with the potential for major thromboembolic complications, at least in a subset of such patients. If a majority of younger more robust patients might tolerate such vascular injury from a vaccine immune response, many elderly and frail patients with cardiovascular disease almost certainly will not.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://noorchashm.medium.com/a-lett...e-7d17d037982d"

(e.g. I could receive the shot on a Friday, the sides don't kick in until Sunday night, and I miss Monday. Or I could receive the shot on a Thursday, the sides kick in the very next morning, and I miss Friday.) Combined with the fact that the vaccine comes in two parts that would likely need to be administered weeks apart, putting both dates within this calendar year. Unfortunately, I'll have to take my chances. \n\nThe general public's motivation to drive to their provider and receive immunizations is not \"out of our duty to serve the greater good\", each individual brings themselves to their provider to receive a calculated and stated protection against FEELING ill. Or so they think. I might get a flu shot, but it doesn't protect me against any other flu-like virus, or any other cause of fever, chills, or muscle aches. If I still get those symptoms that year, as a layperson, I will believe the vaccine was ineffective. If I get those symptoms within a week of receiving the vaccine, I will believe the vaccine caused them. Right or wrong, humans (myself included) will make correlations that are detrimental to the success of the program - such outcomes destroy morale for people who are told to believe in this solution. \n\nI don't think there is any ulterior motive or secret agenda with vaccines. But the economics and risks at a personal level, the wage earner's personal financial picture, weighing their current illness benefits and job protections for actually contracting the virus vs. missing work for the side effects can actually incentivize (as strange as it sounds) electing to forego the vaccine."

Not all family members get it.\n\nDupuytren's Contracture: The immune system is involved, but not exactly like an autoimmune disease. Because it affects the connective tissues, it is a rheumatic disease, but because there is not yet an effective medicine, treated as a surgical disease. https://www.arthritis-research.org/about/dupuytren\n\nSome scientists are concerned about the vaccine triggering conditions like this and autoimmune diseases, but their concerns are either ignored or handwaved away. Some conditions may not show up for a year or more."

I have not reported my case yet, so I guess that would make at least 2 following the Covid Vaccine.And I wonder how many others have not reported it- or maybe don't even know what it is yet.\n\n\n\nThe concern is the immune reaction or overreaction to mRNA vaccines. There is not sufficient evidence to support conclusions on the safety of immune-related adverse events from mRNA vaccines, beyond the common immune-related adverse events (arm soreness, fatigue, fever, headache, etc.).  A research scientist who doesn't have concerns about the unknown, or forms conclusions without sufficient evidence, is no scientist in any sense of the word.\n\nSince you have an immune-related condition, I recommend searching out the research and other information on potential immune-related adverse events from the messenger RNA vaccine. Don't restrict your searches to your particular condition; it's a general immune issue. I'm referring to adverse immune reactions beyond the common ones listed above. I would post some of the research but don't have time to gather it right now. Expect little, if any, transparency from the industry. There is no liability for the vaccines.\n\nWhen the vaccine is administered, lipid droplets of mRNA are taken up by cells in your arm muscle. The cells start making a spike protein so your body \"thinks\" your muscle cells are massively infected with the coronavirus. The immune system kind of goes crazy so the potential for unintended consequences exists. The innate immune system is the one that locates and attacks infection. Antibodies are produced by the adaptive immune system (which also happens without the vaccine when you are infected).\n\nThis vaccination process is helpful for people who have trouble producing antibodies quickly enough to effectively fight off an infection. Most people will probably be fine with the vaccine, but then most people are fine after COVID as well. However, this is no consolation for people who experience consequences from either one."

        "Text": "Side effects from a friend of mine (I didn't ask her which company):\n\nShe said \"I took the first shot almost 3 weeks ago. Yes immediately reacted w intense anxiety and tachycardia. Since then every day gets worse...peripheral neuropathy, muscle pain, muscle weakness , bone pain, arthritis is hands, POTS is back, all Symptoms much worse during the night.   Last night slept for zero minutes. My body gets like a weird shaking inside like Im cold, except its extreme anxiety. \n\nI suggested she read this (from Dr. Mercola):\n\nThe primary reason why I wanted to interview Mikovits was to find out her recommendations for those who chose to get the vaccine and now regret it. Interestingly, what I learned is that you would use the same strategies that you would use to treat the actual SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nI've written many articles over the past year detailing simple strategies to improve your immune system, and with a healthy immune system, you'll get through it without incident even if you end up getting sick. Below, I'll summarize some of the strategies you can use both to prevent COVID-19 and address any side effects you may encounter from the vaccine.\n\nFirst of all, you'll want to eat a \"clean,\" ideally organic diet. Avoid processed foods of all kinds, as they are loaded with damaging omega-6 linoleic acid that wrecks your mitochondrial function. Also consider nutritional ketosis and time-restricted eating, both of which will help you optimize your metabolic machinery and mitochondrial function. As noted by Mikovits:\n\n\"We have to think about detoxing metal, we have to think about glyphosate  We have to prevent inflammation in all tissue sites and we have to keep our immune system healthy  You're going to want to be burning ketones instead [of sugar] for the neuroinflammation, so you're going to want to get into ketosis and take the stress off the mTOR pathway.\"\n\nWith regard to glyphosate, a simple way to block glyphosate uptake is to take glycine. Approximately 3 grams, about half a teaspoon, a few times a day should be sufficient, along with an organic diet, so that you're not adding more glyphosate with each meal.\n\nTo improve detoxification, I recommend activating your natural glutathione production with molecular hydrogen tablets. All of these strategies should help improve your resilience against SARS-CoV-2, and may even help your body detoxify if you've made the mistake of getting this experimental gene therapy.\n\nAnother helpful strategy is to maintain a neutral pH. You want your pH to be right around 7, which you can measure with an inexpensive urine strip.\n\nThe lower your pH, the more acidic you are. A simple way to raise your pH if it's too acidic (and most people are) is to take one-fourth teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate in water a few times a day. Improving your pH will improve the resiliency of your immune system and reduce the mineral loss from your bones, thereby reducing your risk of osteoporosis.\n\nHelpful Supplements:\n\nNutritional supplementation can also be helpful. Among the most important are:\n\nVitamin D  Vitamin D supplements are readily available and one of the least expensive supplements on the market. All things considered, vitamin D optimization is likely the easiest and most beneficial strategy that anyone can do to minimize their risk of COVID-19 and other infections, and can strengthen your immune system in a matter of a few weeks.\n\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC)  NAC is a precursor to reduced glutathione, which appears to play a crucial role in COVID-19. According to one literature analysis,35 glutathione deficiency may actually be associated with COVID-19 severity, leading the author to conclude that NAC may be useful both for its prevention and treatment.\n\nZinc  Zinc plays a very important role in your immune system's ability to ward off viral infections. Like vitamin D, zinc helps regulate your immune function36  and a combination of zinc with a zinc ionophore, like hydroxychloroquine or quercetin, was in 2010 shown to inhibit SARS coronavirus in vitro. In cell culture, it also blocked viral replication within minutes.37 Importantly, zinc deficiency has been shown to impair immune function.38\n\nMelatonin  Boosts immune function in a variety of ways and helps quell inflammation. Melatonin may also prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection by recharging glutathione39 and enhancing vitamin D synthesis, among other things.\n\nVitamin C  A number of studies have shown vitamin C can be very helpful in the treatment of viral illnesses, sepsis and ARDS,40 all of which are applicable to COVID-19. Its basic properties include anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic and antiviral activities. At high doses, it actually acts as an antiviral drug, actively inactivating viruses. Vitamin C also works synergistically with quercetin.41\n\nQuercetin  A powerful immune booster and broad-spectrum antiviral, quercetin was initially found to provide broad-spectrum protection against SARS coronavirus in the aftermath of the 2003 SARS epidemic,42,43,44 and evidence suggests it may be useful for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well.\n\nB vitamins  B vitamins can also influence several COVID-19-specific disease processes, including45 viral replication and invasion, cytokine storm induction, adaptive immunity and hypercoagulability.\n\nMikovits also recommends Type 1 interferons.\n\n\"The type 1 [interferon]  the primary source of interferon, alpha and beta  is the plasmacyte dendritic cell. We know that's dysregulated in people with HIV, with XMRVs, with aberrant retroviral expression. Those people can't make interferon.\n\nType 1 interferons can be provided in a spray that you can spray directly into your throat, your nose, and that will give you the protection you need so that the virus doesn't [replicate]. It degrades it right away  Should you feel cough or fever, headache, immediately up your Type 1 interferon. Take a couple of sprays of that per day prophylactically as well, and that will keep the viral load down.\n\nWe know [SARS-CoV-2] isn't a natural virus, we know this is lab-created, but it'll calm the expression, it'll degrade the RNA for those who can't degrade the RNA, and that's the job of Type 1 interferon  to have your macrophages be these little Pac-Men that simply degrade the RNA.\"\n\nNebulized Peroxide  My Favorite Treatment Choice\n\nMy personal choice for the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms is nebulized peroxide. It's a home remedy I recommend everyone familiarize themselves with, as in many cases it can improve symptoms in mere hours. You can also use it as a preventive strategy if you know you've been exposed to someone who is ill.\n\nNebulizing hydrogen peroxide into your sinuses, throat and lungs is a simple, straightforward way to augment your body's natural expression of hydrogen peroxide to combat infections and can be used both prophylactically after known exposure to COVID-19 and as a treatment for mild, moderate and even severe illness.\n\nDr. David Brownstein, who has successfully treated over 100 COVID-19 patients with nebulized peroxide, published a case paper46 about this treatment in the July 2020 issue of Science, Public Health Policy and The Law. He also reviews its benefits in \"How Nebulized Peroxide Helps Against Respiratory Infections.\"\n\nNebulized hydrogen peroxide is extremely safe, and all you need is a desktop nebulizer and food-grade hydrogen peroxide, which you'll need to dilute with saline to 0.1% strength. I recommend buying these items beforehand so that you have everything you need and can begin treatment at home at the first signs of a respiratory infection."

        "Text": "All I can tell you is this:\n\n1)  I have had the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine.  No significant side effects.  In fact, the only side effect was a very slightly sore arm at the injection site for about 24 hours.  Less sore than with many other vaccines or shots over the years.\n\n2)  I have traveled by air, been in the hospital, gone to church regularly, eaten out, stayed in hotels, gone to the gym, gone to the mall, visited with friends and family inside (especially over the holidays), attended a huge funeral, all that stuff and more, and followed all mandates and rules regarding masks, social distancing, hand sanitizing, as much as possible this entire year.  But I haven't avoided regular events - that's my point. Just taken regular precautions while living life as fully as possible.  I've had several friends, family members, and neighbors test positive for COVID 19.  They quarantined.  None had to be hospitalized thank goodness.  Many were asymptomatic.  For all but two, I would call their symptoms very mild, to non existent.  Once again, thank goodness.  For the two who had a more flu like illness, one is 69, and the other has several pre existing conditions.\n\n3)  I have never tested positive or had any reason to think I might.  Knock on wood.  This is in spite of having two very serious blows - one emotional and one physical (which is why I qualified to get the vaccine, though I am only 59) over the past year, not to mention the stress of the loss of income, a worldwide pandemic, adult kids needing help, etc.\n\n4)  I have worked diligently at keeping my immune system strong and working well over the past several years.  In spite of so much drama and sadness and stress over the past year, I feel great physically.\n\nIt would absolutely gobsmack me if I came down with COVID 19 at this point.\n\nOh, and I did get my flu vaccine again this year.  I get it every year.  One year about five or six years ago, I forgot to get it - and got the flu, which SUCKS for me (for me, if I get the flu, I am down for the count for at least a week, running a fever the entire time, coughing, skin and joints hurting, you name it).  In fact, since getting the flu vaccine, which I've never had a reaction to at all, other than a slightly sore arm sometimes, I have not ever gotten the flu.  Prior to the vaccine, I got it every single year.  Though I am very healthy, for some reason I've just always been succeptible to the flu.  Maybe it's because my entire family contracted the Hong Kong flu back in the day and I remember we were all sick as dogs for WEEKS.  Anyway, I was only 6 but got it. So maybe that makes things worse for me, who knows."

I had a bout of diarrhea on a couple of occasions and a mild cough for a few days which I seldom ever have.  Other than that, no headache, no nausea, no aching, and no lousy feeling.\n\nCan't say for sure that I had the virus because I haven't been concerned enough to go to the hassle of getting tested.  But I'm glad that you and everyone who got the vaccine were able to get it.  Hope that it works as promised with no side effects."

But it's not 'moderate' either. We'll call it milderate soreness. With an emphasis on the mild.\n\nNo chills, no fever.. I did NOT sleep well last night. Though part of this was because the dog kept sticking her nose in my face for some reason. I've got a few aches and pains.. I can tell something isn't quite right, but.. I could just as easily believe it was due to the bad night of sleep. I'm working today. Certainly isn't bad enough to interfere with my normal routine..

It's sad the FDA or CDC doesn't tell people how to boost their immune systems and just focus on vaccine.  If people boost their immune system through available nutrients, it will save lots of lives.

All vaccines are tracked for \"adverse events,\" but some critics are playing up the side effects of these vaccines and sowing doubt about their emergency use authorizations. I don't think the motive is to make it harder to end the pandemic, although that may be the effect. Instead, I would suspect the belief is either that the pandemic is not a great threat or that letting it run its course naturally is the best way to respond to the pandemic. \n\nIn my case, both Pfizer shots resulted in a slightly sore arm the next day but no other issues."

I got the dose at 6pm, the next morning (at about 4am, when I normally wake up) I had a headache and started feeling achy all over. Later in the day it had progressed to all-over body aches, particularly in my back, and stabbing pains in my head (I don't think my thermometer is accurate--its a digital cvs brand that's like maybe 10 yrs old; the highest it read was 99.6 which is rather high for what it normally reads, even when I feel like I have a fever; so I may have had a low-grade fever). It was painful to walk in a way I can't really describe (mostly a horrible feeling seeming to originate from my head). Incredibly weak. The day after was quite better, but I still felt weak and had pain all over, but not as bad as the first day (though still fairly bad). Beginning of day 3 still felt kind of weary, but not really in that much pain. Part way through day 3 I felt back to normal.\n\n\n\nQuote:\n\n\n\n\nOriginally Posted by Jessie Mitchell\n\n\nI had only some arm pain after the first Moderna shot. The second one was a very different response; very sore arm, headache, congestion, bone deep fatigue, fever and chills. I was feeling good again about 36 hours after that second shot. It was intense, but thankfully came and went. Now I just feel so happy and relieved to be vaccinated.\n\n\n\nThat's very similar to what happened with me with the 2nd Moderna dose, except no congestion and chills and maybe not a fever. I think it lasted longer for me too (total of about like 60 hours, though the absolute worst was the first 24 hours of when the side effects started). The fatigue was incredible. The stabbing headache pains were intense--thought I was going to have a stroke or something for some of them."

How do you feel that you got the J&J one? Is that the one you wanted and are you disappointed you got it? \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been five days since I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and I have had no side affects except what I mentioned about pain at injection site the day I received it.  I had more pain from the two Shringex shots.\n\nA friend told me that they had started accepting people with hypertension to get the vaccine.  As I'm not quite 65 years old (later this year), I was happy to get vaccinated.  I got an appointment from CVS Pharmacy.  The location I went to had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  I know other people who went to different CVS locations and were given Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nI try to avoid all the negative information about the vaccines.  When the experts and Dr. Fauci say get vaccinated, I did.     I was happy to get one because my state is opening up 100% with no mask mandate.  Through this whole ordeal many people don't understand that when wearing a mask you still have to socially distance yourself.  When masks don't fit snuggly to your face, being socially distant helps others."

I have the 2nd dose on March 20th and I'm not looking forward to it.  In my case I wondered if the fact I had Covid in Dec, had any bearing on the severity of the side effects.  I thought perhaps the vaccine is reacting to the antibodies I already have from the infection.  The reaction I had were some of the same symptoms I had when I had Covid.  The chills and headache being the worse.     Whatever happened its not fun, and I hope you are doing well now.    I'm glad most people don't have the side effects."

He went to the ER of course.  His platelet count was zero.  He was admitted and the Doctor's could not help him.  He died 15 days later of a brain hemorrhage.\n\nGranted his is a very rare case.  But his is not the only case of deadly results from the vaccine worldwide that even medical professionals believe are the results of being vaccinated.  Pfizer naturally does not believe the vaccine was the cause although nothing else explains what happened to Dr Michael.  They (Pfizer) said they are following all such cases closely.\n\nNow, there are certainly not enough deaths from the vaccine, in comparison to the high number of people successfully vaccinated to make them something people should use to avoid the vaccine unless they have real physical reasons to avoid the vaccine.\n\nThat said, Dr Michael was SOMEBODY to his wife, family and patients, and he died.\n\nWhen you talk about posts trying to spread untruths, please dont overlook the possibility of your own.\n\n\nhttps://www.bing.com/videos/search?q...0&&FORM=VDRVSR"

I could have gone to work, if I'd had to, or to the grocery store or whatever but I'm glad I didn't have to do anything other than lay on the sofa.\n\nThis was six days ago and I've had no other symptoms other than a very slight itch and sore area of the arm at the injection site - less sore than just about any other shot I can recall, but also itchy which I've never experienced before.  No outward swelling or sign of a rash.   That lasted a few days but is all gone now."

I keep saying it because it is true, whether you accept it or not.\n\nSomeone who drops dead after getting a vaccine may be found to have a congenital anomaly of an artery in the heart, for example.\n\nUltimately it is epidemiology that will tease out whether the vaccine might cause any condition. If the condition is no more frequent after vaccination than it is in the general population, it is difficult to blame it on the vaccine. Also, if you blame the vaccine you have to provide the mechanism by which the vaccine did it.\n\n\n\nI dont believe you Sue.  It is rather obvious you are trying to divert the natural flow of the conversation away from the article of the 39 year old woman that died in Utah, which is the source where discussion of autopsies originates from , to steer it toward some personal agenda you have.\n\nSo have at it.  Take the thread away from the reality that an autopsy can never be used to prove a vaccine caused injury and death.  Take the conversation away from how an autopsy can help the family understand why their loved one died, and if no competing cause of death exists, it will at least appear that the vaccine should be suspected.\n\nGo ahead.

She had no reaction except for a very sore arm at the injection site for a full week afterwards. We received them at our local pharmacy where they had us wait 15 minutes before we could leave. Good thing, because for about 10 minutes my equilibrium was off. After about 5 minutes I had stood up for a couple of seconds for some reason and felt like I might tip over. Sitting back down for another 5 was all I needed. Only other issue I had was extreme tiredness for the following two days.\n\nI was very fortunate. When I took my mother in for her vaccination shot they asked if I wanted one too because someone else hadn't shown up and they couldn't reach them. If they had asked a day or two prior I wouldn't have qualified due to age restrictions but that had just been lowered I believe the day prior. \n\n Both my mother and I were hoping for the J&J vaccination after seeing how awful my sister felt after receiving her second dose of Moderna's vaccine. She works for a hospital so was one of the first ones to get it. They had to send her home from work she was in such bad shape. Said she felt like she had been run over by a truck. Headache and couldn't get enough sleep for a full week, she was that tired.\n\n Honestly, I would have taken either of those two or Pfizer's. I'm more concerned about the virus than I am the vaccine. First one available to me was the one I'd be taking. Feel much more comfortable knowing I wont end up in the hospital ICU even if I get the virus.\n\nLooks like most of our citizens will have the opportunity to be vaccinated by the end of May or June. Then more focus can be placed on vaccinating the rest of the world, as well as possible future booster shots."

Hundreds of reports on VAERS already for DVT's & PE's.\n\nWhich in itself is interesting because Covid itself was associated with clotting disorders. Even \"covid toe\", from microclots.\n\nSomething is going wrong but it will take years to \"prove\" if it was the vaccines.

Is it anywhere close to the 2.72 million deaths due to COVID? Just trying to figure out which one is riskier."

Do you realize that by propagating your invalid numbers and your understandable but overblown fears that people might avoid getting vaccinated and get sick or die from covid, far more than would ever suffer serious side effects from getting vaccinated? Are you prepared to accept responsibility for causing more harm than good?  If you save one person from vaccine harm and 10 people die or suffer long term complications who would have lived or recovered fully if only they had been vaccinated, are you OK with that? If so, how can you be?"

        "Text": "Hey, all I can tell you is this:\n\nI'm 59 years old, I'm white and middle class and American.   As plain Jane as one can be, most likely.\n\nI am a former military dependent and have lived all over the world, and have the immunizations to prove it.  Also, remember, I grew up in the AGE OF IMMUNIZATIONS.  This was when medical teams would come to our schools and we'd all line up outside the cafeteria and go in a few at a time to be given some sort of vaccination for something or other.  I clearly remember several times that we'd get pamphlets about the vaccines the day before or that morning, and then we'd all line up and roll our shirt sleeves up and get the shots.  No one I have ever known anywhere any time has ever responded negatively to a vaccine.  Of course, that's anecdotal but believe me, a negative reaction would have gotten my attention.\n\nI've never had a negative reaction.  Oh and on top of all the many required vaccinations for travel and moving and school and all that that I had over the decades, I also had to have the rabies series when we lived in Japan when I was a kid, because they were having a rabies scare and I had picked up some stray cat (that we couldn't find afterward) that had bitten me right on the neck (weird behavior - in fact, the cat was acting strange).  At the time, it required 14 days in a row of a big long needle and shot in my stomach each day.  GOOD TIMES!  But hey, no negative side effects, and no rabies either.  \n\nI've gotten boosters of various vaccines over the years as an adult - no negative reactions at all.  Also, no sickness (whatever the various vaccines were for).  \n\nAbout ten years ago, I started getting the flu vaccine regularly.  At first, I just got it because it was required where I worked.  Every single year, I caught the flu and it was always severe - a solid week in bed, high fever, coughing, aches, skin hurting, you name it.  I came down with pneumonia twice during battles with the flu over the years before the flu vaccine.  Though I am a ridiculously healthy person overall, for some strange reason, I always caught the flu during flu season and it was always severe.  So then I started getting the flu shot - and every year that I'd get a flu shot, I just wouldn't get the flu.  No matter what the strain was, what the vaccine was so to speak - if I got the vaccine, I didn't get the flu.  And one year I FORGOT to get the vaccine, and I got the flu!  Crazy.\n\nSo when the COVID 19 vaccine came out, I researched it and decided to go for it.  I've detailed my reactions to the two shot Pfizer vaccine but I'll simplify it:  After the first shot, which I literally couldn't even feel being administered, my arm was very slightly sore - less sore than after an flu shot I've ever gotten.  Absolutely zero other side effects.  After the 2nd shot, which hurt being administered a little more but still nothing noteworthy really, I felt fine (got in in the morning) till about 2 am that next night, when I woke up with chills and a fever.  I took some OTC fever something or other, put on some wooly socks, and promptly went back to sleep.  I woke up the next morning feeling fine, went to church, went out to eat afterward, and as we were getting ready to leave the restaurant, I suddenly felt very tired and feverish.  This is about 30 hours after the second shot.  I went home, changed into comfy clothes, and laid down on the sofa and watched a movie and dozed.  I think I took some tylenol or something.  Anyway, I never had a headache or nausea - I just felt super tired and I knew I had a fever (I was cold).  I took my temp several times - it was about 3 degrees warmer than usual but still low grade.  About six hours later, around 8 pm. the fever went away as suddenly as it had come, and I felt 100 percent fine.  \n\nNo problems afterward. No blood clots, no hearing loss, nothing.  \n\nI've never gotten COVID 19.  Now I believe that winning streak will continue indefinitely.  I am glad I got the vaccine and would get it again, I'd get it every year or probably even twice a year.  I mean, my goodness, I get a flu shot every year.  It's just no big deal to me.\n\nBy the way, my kids are all in their 30s.  They've all had all their vaccinations over the years.  Zero issues with them too.  They are just waiting for availability of this vaccine now.\n\nDefinitely worth it in my book."

My sister had it too.  We woke up Xmas morning sick as dogs; fever, chills, aches, nausea.\nI started getting the flu shot yearly when they started offering it at work.  I don't want to ever skip a year.  Getting pneumonia twice is very dangerous!  Yikes.  Did you ever have a tetanus?  I had one at work,\nleft a red hot welt.  Also, they gave us the Hepatitis B(?) Vaccine (series of 3).  Not sure if it expired by now. \nI had the Chicken Pox and Measles as a child - not fun either.  It must have been just prior to the MMR.  My youngest sister who was born in 1970 never had Chicken Pox or Measles - she was vaccinated."

Its too bad you didn't find out for whatever reason but its pretty common knowledge now, even in Seniorsville. \nBut you also can't predict your reaction based on her reaction. Your chances of having no side effects are better than your chances of having the similar side effects as her, unless you are younger then its about 50/50 I think."

I am not, but I think it's wise to consider alternatives to everyone getting two shots as soon as they can.\n\n\n\n100% agree. If you have the luxury to get the one you want, do it.

That may be yet another reason for me not to take any of the Covid vaccines.  I read the link you posted and many of those cases sound pretty bad.\n\nI've had tinnitus for many years due to being in the Army and hearing damage from that.  Quite honestly, I've gotten so used to it that I don't even notice it most of the time now.  Maybe after all these years it is diminishing somewhat.  I would sure hate to get a vaccine shot and really aggravate the condition and cause it to flare up badly again.  \n\nIt can be really bad because there's no way to get away from it.  It's with you 24/7 although I guess I don't really notice it when I'm asleep, but sometimes trying to get to sleep can be a problem for all the noises going on in my ears.  In fact, just thinking about it now has caused me to realize that the buzzing is still going on in there."

He works in a trade and very well could have irritated it with some type of solvent or who knows what, but I'm mildly concerned (as a worrywart mother is prone to be) that it had something to do with the vaccine. I can't find anything with that side effect, though. And it's mild... his fingertips are pink and peeled a tiny bit, and he says they're sore at work.

If your hesitant, just do it.  No one I know who got it regrets it."

The normal immune system effects are fever, chills, muscle aches, and injection site pain. They should be gone within two or three days.\n\nOP, I hope you're feeling better today. If you're worried, then by all means, call your doctor. But know that it is completely  normal. Some people have a higher fever than others, but 102 is in no way dangerous. It's just your body creating antibodies that will protect you when/if you are exposed to the virus in the wild. In two weeks, you'll be protected, and you can feel confident that you have the antibodies you need!"

He told me to sit down and I wanted to ask a couple questions, but he quickly grabbed my arm, pinched my upper arm skin very hard and administered the vaccine with no warning.  Didnt even ask if I had an arm preference (I did).\n\nHe placed the shot way up high, more in my shoulder than in my arm.  I swear, its like he hit a nerve or something because Ive had pins and needles feeling in my arm and hands since the shot.  And searing pain in my clavicle, neck and shoulder area.\n\nSo then he told me to wait around 15 mins before leaving.  Never checked back with me and I approached the pharmacy counter to ask a question, but was quickly dismissed.\n\nI did call again this morning, only to have my concerns completely dismissed again by the pharmacist.\n\nI have a call into my personal drs office.

To say I am displeased would be an understatement.\n\nFirst of all, when I was called back for the shot - I noticed the pharmacist did not even change gloves between patients.  He told me to sit down and I wanted to ask a couple questions, but he quickly grabbed my arm, pinched my upper arm skin very hard and administered the vaccine with no warning.  Didnt even ask if I had an arm preference (I did).\n\nHe placed the shot way up high, more in my shoulder than in my arm.  I swear, its like he hit a nerve or something because Ive had pins and needles feeling in my arm and hands since the shot.  And searing pain in my clavicle, neck and shoulder area.\n\nSo then he told me to wait around 15 mins before leaving.  Never checked back with me and I approached the pharmacy counter to ask a question, but was quickly dismissed.\n\nI did call again this morning, only to have my concerns completely dismissed again by the pharmacist.\n\nI have a call into my personal drs office.  Needless to say, I wont be getting the 2nd vaccine.  Already cancelled it.\n\n\n\nI went to one of the mega sites to get vaccinated by the army. They were quick and efficient but they did ask if I had any questions, an arm preference, if I understood which shot i was getting (pfizer) and asked me before I left the 15 minute observation if i was well and felt ok.\n\nI was sick that day and for the next few days but its passed now. You should contact walgreens customer care line and complain. Even if youre just there for the vaccine they should not be treating you as though you are not a patient. Then schedule your 2nd vaccine for a different place. \n\nPeople are treating the patients getting the vaccine like cattle making their way through processing with no concern for their treatment or wellbeing. I know the goal is to get as many people vaccinated as possible they should be offering patient care."

If you didn't like the perfunctory treatment you got from that particular pharmacist the call you should be making is to that Walgreens manager. Lodge a complaint. This has nothing to do with the vaccine itself. Get your second shot somewhere else.\n\nPeople's experiences being vaccinated vary all across the board. I've had both vaccinations. Both were handled perfectly. The whole thing was a non-issue.\n\n\n\nI have lodged a complaint, both with the store and the corporate customer service.  Like I said, I called my own drs office and they are going to see about getting me rescheduled elsewhere.  \n\nPlease, lets not be harsh.  I am hesitant to go ahead with the 2nd vaccine knowing my reaction to the first."

If anything, it has improved simply because I was very nervous before my second vaccine and was having a lot of ectopic beats. I also had some shortness of breath (again, this was before my vaccine). Once I had the shot and was done being observed for 15 minutes, I only felt relief and the ectopics and SOB went away. Our  minds can do crazy things to us and cause very strong and convincing symptoms. I have GAD as well as a form of OCD, so I am used to having physical manifestations of my anxiety. \n\nI'm not suggesting that your sudden arrhythmia is necessarily from anxiety, by the way. Just telling you how mine tends to work."

If anything, it has improved simply because I was very nervous before my second vaccine and was having a lot of ectopic beats. I also had some shortness of breath (again, this was before my vaccine). Once I had the shot and was done being observed for 15 minutes, I only felt relief and the ectopics and SOB went away. Our  minds can do crazy things to us and cause very strong and convincing symptoms. I have GAD as well as a form of OCD, so I am used to having physical manifestations of my anxiety. \n\nI'm not suggesting that your sudden arrhythmia is necessarily from anxiety, by the way. Just telling you how mine tends to work.\n\n\n\n\nI mentioned this before.. I think an awful lot of people are so concerned/nervous that they're psyching themselves into issues. Especially the 'bad sleep' issues. \n\nNot all.. But certainly some.\n\nAs I've mentioned, I had a bad nights sleep after the first dose, but, I had alot of family in town staying at my house for a funeral. Not my side of the family, but, funeral for someone who died from COVID. So.. was that due to the vaccine or just because.. I had a house full of people? This is in addition to the sore arm.\n\n\n\nAfter the second dose.. I had some aches and pains the next day, though nothing bad. Plus the sore arm. Now, were the aches and pains because of the vaccine, or were the aches and pains because.. Well, I'm nearly 50 and. You know, sometimes I just have some aches and pains now?\n\n\nI choose to attribute both of those symptoms just to circumstances and not the vaccine. Could they have been due to it? Sure. But, both instances, I've felt like that without having the vaccine, so.. Choose your point of view.\n\n\nWhat I *CAN* say for certain.. I had zero side effects after the first dose of placebo I received in the trial. Now, you can say \"Well, no crap\".. But, I didn't know whether I had gotten the vaccine or placebo.. So, that at least says that my mind wasn't inventing symptoms on me. Which I suppose you could use as evidence that the ones I did get were vaccine induced.. But.. They were so minor, all told, not even worth worrying about."

How does this explain never having any reaction until I got older? Maybe its just how we are interpreting the statement that a reaction shows a properly functioning immune system. That may very well be true, but it doesn't (necessarily, IMO) mean that the converse is true. Little or no noticeable reaction doesn't mean an improperly functioning immune system or that the vaccine didn't work. I'm willing to be swayed but haven't seen anything to sway me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n\n\n\n\nOriginally Posted by NoMansLands\n\n\nTo reply to all posts questioning this, I'm not a virologist so after hearing that a strong response correlates to a strong immune system, I believed it. So I just did a small amount of digging on the subject. I came up with this:\n\nHow do you know if you have a strong immune response to pathogens?\n\nRemaining healthy despite a frequent exposure to a large number of pathogens on a daily bases is one sign of having a strong immune system. Another sign of a strong immune system is the natural response to vaccination. Most vaccines include immune stimulants (called adjuvants), which are needed to activate the innate immune system and make vaccines work better. Activation of the innate immune system is commonly associated with a short-term increase in body temperature that usually lasts 24 hours. This means that developing a mild fever following vaccination indicates a person has a properly functioning immune system.\n\n\nWhich came from here: https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/C...mmunity-Yasser\nAsk an expert about immune response. \n\nSo the fine details may not be known completely, I see what you are saying. I also believe what is written above, that developing a mild fever following vaccination indicates a person has a properly functioning immune system.\n\n\n\n"

I don't want to call it urban legend, but it's not proven.\n\n\nRight now, we don't particularly know why some people have a stronger immune response.. It is possible that the people having stronger reactions (Particularly on the first shot) have unknowingly been infected in the past. It's also possible that people who have a stronger immune response to the vaccine would have had a similar immune response to the virus, which could mean that they would have had a severe, and possibly fatal, case of COVID.\n\nJust look at the immune response, whatever it is, as a net positive. Things are working as they should.\n\n\n\nI had COVID back in November and my case was fairly mild. Maybe this explains the side effects."

The probability that the vaccines will ever be found to be more dangerous than the disease is infinitesimally small.\n\nThey were not \"inadequately tested\". The money available made it possible to do large studies, and some that would have been done in sequence were done side by side instead. In addition, the companies started making vaccine before the studies were complete, gambling that they would get the EUAs. It was not necessary to wait for it to be produced - and in large quantities. In order to get the EUA safety and efficacy had to be demonstrated, and they were.\n\nNow the data on millions of doses administered confirms that efficacy and safety. Both Pfizer and Moderna are preparing applications for full licensure and probably will have it before the end of the year."

She has been diagnosed with dementia despite showing no signs of dementia prior to Vaccination Day. \n\nI visited my parents one month ago.  Mom had just renewed her driver's license, could walk, care for her dogs, and even offered to cook me pecan pies for the trip home.  Today, she cannot walk, hold a coffee cup, nor remember that her mom died 18-years ago.  \n\nWe spoke briefly and while her speech was clear, she spoke mostly of someone named Melvin before calling 911.\n\nRapidly progressive dementia can be a product of an overactive immune system.  The doctors that have been treating my dad for the last three months claim that the vaccine elicited an immune response that \"blew up\" a mild, undetected UTI that has ultimately resulted in the dysfunction of his bladder, requiring a suprapubic catheter.\n\n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your mom.  My mom's vascular dementia progressed quickly, especially after she broke her hip and had to have surgery.\n\nIt also got a lot worse when she had a UTI so be sure your mom is checked for that as well as vascular dementia.  There are several main types of dementia and some types can progress very quickly."

I can't tell you how many times I have gotten stopped driving while being a person of color (brown) even with my white coat on. Some stories are just absurd. They always have me open the trunk and I would carry in a grocery bag some vacutainer needles holders and tubes and they would say what is this? Are you legally able to carry? You would think it's a weapon. I would show them my national registry card and they would let me go. I have had dogs brought in just to search my car again simply crossing a border patrol check point. \n\nAnyways back to the topic and that is drug users do have fresh marks and bruises depending on where they try and hide the sticks. Their veins are shot and feel hard as a rock. Very problematic finding one that is nice  patent vein. They will tell you where to stick it in at but sometimes they are wrong for our purpose which means it fills too slow and ends up clotted. Most of the time they are syringe draw to try and suck it out as fast as possible. Police can see track marks if not the whole blown vein."

Is there any correlation between the reactions to a tetnus shot, or flu shot and the COVID vaccination shot? If you \"got the flu\" from the flu shot, does that mean you'll likely have a strong reaction to the COVID vax?\n\n\n\n\nNo I haven't heard of it, and I already mentioned getting an owie from tetanus. I've had Measles Mumps Rubella a couple times, no reaction, tetanus or diptheria-tetanus-pertussis, no reaction other than soreness (which I don't think reflects a systemic immune response), flu many times, no reaction, Jahnssen covid vax, no reaction, Shingrix stands alone as the only vaccine in my life I've had a substantial reaction to. And yet I was older for it than all of the others except the covid shot, by 3 months. \n\n\nI distinctly remember getting vaccinated for polio as a child, no reaction. i'[ll admit I don't remember getting the smallpox vaccine, but I have no reason to believe I had any reaction. \n\n\n\nI think Suzy's theory is the stronger one at this point, but I don't consider the question settled."

I had what I would consider a mild but expected response to the COVID vax (unlike zero response other than a sore injection site for a couple of days from the \"flu shot).  I mean, I felt tired and ran a low grade fever for about 36 hours - off and on, not constant - after the COVID 19 shot and then suddenly, BOOM, it lifted.  I can tell you exactly when I suddenly felt fine - it was at 8 pm Sunday evening, and I had my second vaccination (Pfizer) the day before around 10 am.  I had no symptoms at all till about 10 pm Saturday night - low grade fever and chills - but they went away after I took an ibuprofen.  Then Sunday morning I felt fine, went to church and felt fine through church and then out to eat afterward, but then when we were nearly done with our meal, suddenly I just felt extremely tired and by the time we got home, I had a low grade fever which lasted till 8 pm, so I felt tired and had mild chills off and on.  No worries - it was Sunday and I just laid on the sofa and binge watched something or other and a few hours later I felt fine.\n\nSo I don't know whether I would call that mild or \"strong.\"  Some might call it either way.  I just know I had some symptoms I considered to be mild but which would have kept me from doing anything significant like going to work or shopping or going out with friends or whatever.

I believe it was responsible for tracking the blood clot issue with J&J.. Though that was somewhat known from Europe previously as I believe it's in the same family as the AZ vaccine which also had an issue with blood clots. Not positive about that, but think they're the same style of vaccine. \n\n\n\nSo.. Hard to argue with its success. And, the fact that the J&J has been out far less time than Pfizer or Moderna and they identified an issue with it and not with the others.. Not sure that there's anything for them to find."

And Ill probably get the same version for my second dose.\n\nHaving read through a few comments on American vaccines and their side-effects, I must say that I got pretty much the same side-effects with the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThe actual injection was fine - I made sure that I had it in my left arm, as I knew that it would probably make my arm sore eventually. As I am right-handed, I wanted to keep that arm ok, so I could carry on using it to make food and drink etc.\n\nSo I had the injection around lunch time, and like I said, I was fine first of all but by the time evening came around, I got really tired so went to bed. I wish Id taken some Paracetamol before bed, as I woke up around three or four hours late feeling all shivery, like I was coming down with something.\n\nThe next day, I was exhausted and just kept going back to bed to sleep. I also had achy joints and a headache, so I kept taking Paracetamol every four hours or so. And I wasnt cold and shivery anymore I came out in a sweat a few times.\n\nI still felt tired the day after that. I felt a bit nauseous at one point, so I went back to bed, with a bucket next to me - but I wasnt actually sick, I just fell asleep. The next day, I felt a bit better. And so I carried on getting better every day from then on. \n\nTo anyone who has just had the vaccine dont worry, you will feel better soon. Just take it easy - have lots of sleep, plenty of water to drink, and take some Paracetamol.\n\nAnd for anyone whos vaccine is coming up make sure you get some easy to cook meals in, as you wont feel like doing much cooking afterwards! And if you are right-handed, like I am, then offer up your left arm to be injected. And if you are left-handed, then do the opposite! \n\nGood luck everyone."

If they want to sell this to the public they need to figure out ways to make this little easier taking 2-3 days off from work to get a vaccine is not a long term solution.\n\nI understand with most vaccines in history the first ones did have lot of side effects hopefully they figure out ways to make this work with less of a reaction to them."

Even though I did have some side effects for 36 hours or so after the second shot, they were mild and over with by the evening of the day after the shot.  If I had HAD to go in to work, I could have, but I just planned it for over a weekend and a day I wasn't going to be doing anything anyway.  I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to go out on the lake or anything like that but I was fine laying around taking the occasional Tylenol or aspirin and watching movies in my jammies!

But I think it's best to be prepared for the worst and just hope for the best!\n\nThat's why when I had my two shots, I intentionally didn't plan anything for that day or the next and though I had zero negative symptoms after shot #1, I did have a few after shot #2 so I was glad I cleared my schedule.  I had a rather nice time laying around in pajamas binge watching something or other.  Can't really remember because I think I slept a lot - LOL.\n\nAnyway, suddenly at 8 pm on the dot, the fever left and I felt GREAT.  Not just good, not just OK, but great.  I think it had to do with sleeping all day - Ha!  Anyway, I had a burst of energy and so I went and cleaned out a closet!"

        "Text": "Well, after thinking about it for the past 4 or 5 months and carefully weighing what I perceived to be the risk/reward ratio, I got my first Covid vaccine shot today.  Believe me, I was not an easy sell.  In fact, I don't think that ANY of the arguments that people made influenced me much, if any, at all.  I think that what finally did the trick was simply the accumulation of the numerical data.  \n\nAfter all, I'm a numbers guy.  Emotional arguments and scare tactics have little effect on me.  But finally, the numbers seem to favor taking the vaccine even though the vaccine itself has some risk involved.\n\nI got the Pfizer shot #1 at my local Walgreen's pharmacy today.  Went online this morning, clicked on the local Walgreen's pharmacy, answered a few question, selected a convenient time before noon, went there and got the shot right on time.  In and out in less than 20 minutes.  They didn't even ask me to wait for 15 minutes before I left.  I felt fine, so I left immediately.  \n\nMy wife had both Pfizer shots and finished up about a month ago.  She had absolutely zero side effects from the vaccines other than the slightest of a sore arm, and even that wasn't much.  She had no chills, no aches, no pains, no headache, no lethargy, no sleepy spells... nothing!   I hope to have the same experience she did, but I won't be surprised if I do have more side effects than her.  \n\nAnyway, just thought I'd report that I got the shot.  If I don't check back in and update you with how it goes for the next few days, you'll know that the shot killed me and I want someone here to be sure to report it to VAERS since I won't be able to.

The second dose was far less of a problem; I tasted copper on my tongue for the first day or so but was not nearly as sore or stiff, though I still suffered chills and was feverish the first night.

So WFM which was new for numerous people wasn't new to us. Many of us have known each other for decades. We've had access to gym's and exercise equipment 24/7 that was always kept clean to start with. We all had access to mostly fresh food and had services similar to Instacart in the US. Normal sleep cycles.\n\nFirst off, none of know of anyone who died of Covid or know anyone got Covid.\n\nAfter the 1st shot, some had the more common side effects that came and went within two days. After the 2nd shot, it was similar to the 1st shot in the beginning. Keep in mind we're in a country where US type seasonal allergies don't happen. After a few weeks passed most of us felt tiredness and fatigue. Some of us had flu/cold/seasonal allergies type of symptoms. As of today (other than what we already had or due to age) depending on the person some still have joint pain, weakness, nausea, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, stomach issues. The gift that keeps on giving that I got is breathing issues where per a oximeter I was given has shown my oxygen level continue to slowly drop. Our doctors didn't find any causes. I finally flew into the US in March (finding a nearly direct flight from the UAE to JFK is nearly impossible, but I did with a transfer through Israel) and have been going through testing in the US. Don't have asthma. Did get back seasonal allergies I haven't had in decades. Initially given a rescue inhaler and since has jumped to a inhaler called Breo. Portable oxygen is coming this week as now I'm down to 88 on my oximeter.\n\nI've had other issues pop up, but for now I'm going to blame it on not having access to what I had before, getting used to American food again and adjusting to different water."

I realize that the following excerpt is not from a medical site but it's in plain English, which was important for me.  This may have been posted here already but, just in case, it may explain why some people react badly to the Moderna shots:\n\nEach dose of Pfizers contains 30 micrograms of vaccine. Moderna went with a much larger dose of vaccine, 100 micrograms. It means the company is using a little more than three times as much vaccine per person as Pfizer is. And yet, they arent getting better results. The governments vaccine development program, formerly called Operation Warp Speed, has asked Moderna to test if it could lower the dosage of its vaccine without eroding the vaccines protection.\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2021/02/02/...hnson-johnson/"

But, day after that, in the aft., got waves of nausea w/ chills/warm flushes. Next day, very minor and one day after that, more minor yet. I didn't realize how much covid affects the GI, but apparently it does. My temp was 98.5, but is usually 96.8 or 97.5 so it was very slight, too.\nI took Vit. C before and after inj, along w/ extra fluids. I also rested a lot weekend before and a few days after. I'm glad I got it though! You had it rough. I think booster talk is only a possibility because the antibodies may last for many months or even years after. They don't know yet, but a booster would only be once/year. Let's hope for long term antibodies though."

When I felt tired, I went inside and had a glass of water, then felt better in short order.   A friend of mine had a bad headache, fatigue/tiredness, chills, etc. He was under the weather for about 2 days.   So the J&J shot affects people differently for sure.  I actually \"trained\" for the shot by doing my daily cardio routine extra hard for 3 days leading up to the shot. I went to bed early to be well-rested for any side effects that might come at me."
